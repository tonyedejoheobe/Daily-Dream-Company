    <p class="p2">This cake is truly a decadent dessert, perfect for a special occasion, like Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine’s Day, or a birthday party. There are a few components at play here, but don’t be intimidated. I’ll walk you through each and every step in the blog post, with lots of tips & step-by-step photos. If you’re pinched for time, see my recipe variations at the bottom of the blog post for some time savers. But, this beauty is truly worth the time and effort! Let’s dive in.</p>
    <p class="p1"><strong>Chocolate Truffle Cake</strong> is a decadent chocolate dream! Layers of ultra moist, rich chocolate cake are slathered in milk chocolate buttercream and topped with a luscious chocolate ganache drip. Homemade chocolate truffles on top take the whole cake right over the top! There’s no better cake for a celebration than this beauty.</p></div>  
    <p class="p3"><strong>Rich Chocolate Cake –</strong>This rich, one-bowl chocolate cake is the easiest and best chocolate cake you’ll ever make! No matter your baking skills, you can make this cake.<br><br><strong>Silky Milk Chocolate Frosting –</strong>I’ve never had a better chocolate frosting, and I’m sure you’ll feel the same. Melted milk chocolate is beaten into softened butter, with powdered sugar, a little cocoa, and cream cheese for the silkiest, most chocolatey frosting. It tastes like chocolate truffle filling!<br><br><strong>Chocolate Ganache Drip –</strong> Chocolate truffles are made with chocolate ganache, so adding a ganache drip to this cake gives it the full effect!<br><br><strong>Chocolate Truffles –</strong> Naturally, I had to top off this chocolate truffle cake with actual chocolate truffles! They’re easier to make than you might think, and take just two ingredients plus cocoa, chocolate, or nuts for dipping. They pack a big wow factor!</p>
    <p class="p4"><i>As always, the full recipe with measurements & directions can be found at the bottom of this post.</i></p>
    <p class="p5"><strong>Butter –</strong> I always use salted buter for the best flavor, but feel free to use unsalted butter if you prefer. We’re using this instead of vegetable oil in this cake to add extra richness!<br><br><strong>Sour Cream – </strong>Use full fat sour cream at room temperature for best results.<br><br><strong>Cake Flour–</strong> Cake flour produces a more tender crumb in a cake and I highly recommend using it! Spoon & level your flour for best results, or use a scale. Scooping the measuring cup directly in will lead to too much flour, giving you a dry cake. 1 cup of cake flour is 110 grams, whereas 1 cup of all-purpose flour is 130 grams.<br><br><strong>Cocoa Powder –</strong>Use natural cocoa powder, not dutch process.<br><br><strong>Milk –</strong>I always use 2% milk for baking because it’s what we already buy.<br><br><strong>Cream Cheese –</strong>Use full fat, block-style cream cheese.<br><br><strong>Heavy Whipping Cream –</strong>Also called heavy cream, this must be used for the chocolate truffles – there’s not something you can substitute for it.</p>
    <p class="p6"><strong>Dairy-free –</strong> Use your favorite, trusted dairy-free products to make this recipe dairy-free.<br><br>
      <strong>Gluten-free –</strong> I have not tested a gluten-free version of this cake. Let me know if you do!<br><br>
      <strong>Sour Cream –</strong> You can use full fat greek yogurt, at room temperature, in place of the sour cream.<br><br>
      <strong>Cake Flour Substitute –</strong> Make your own cake flour by spooning & leveling 1 cup of flour into a measuring cup, using a flat edge to level it off. Add to a mixing bowl, then remove two tablespoons (scoop & level them off). Add two tablespoons of corn starch, then sift this mixture twice. This is important to evenly mix the ingredients and to give the same light texture as cake flour.</p>
    <p class="p7"><strong>Step 1: Make the Cake Batter.</strong> Whisk together the dry ingredients, then mix in the wet ingredients until just combined. It’s the easiest chocolate cake recipe you’ll ever make!</p>
    <p class="p8"><strong>Step 2: Bake the Cake Layers.</strong> Divide the batter between greased and parchment paper-lined cake pans. Bake as directed in the recipe card below. Cool in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes before inverting layers to cool completely.</p>
    <p class="p9"><strong>Step 3: Make the Frosting.</strong> In a large mixing bowl, melt the milk chocolate. Beat that with softened butter, then beat in powdered sugar, a splash of milk, vanilla, a pinch of salt, and finally some cream cheese. This is the most luscious frosting!</p>
    <p class="p10"><strong>Step 4: Frost the Cake.</strong> Spread a layer of frosting over the first cake layer, then add the second layer of cake. Pop in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes or so, to ensure nothing slides around while you’re working with the cake. Repeat with the second cake layer, then add the third layer upside down for a perfectly flat top. Frost the outside of the cake with the remaining frosting. Let chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.</p>
    <p class="p11"><strong>Step 5: Make Chocolate Truffles.</strong> The base of this recipe is simple – pour simmering heavy cream over chopped semi-sweet chocolate in a heatproof bowl, then stir until completely smooth. Chill this in the fridge until it’s solid, then scoop into balls. Chill them again and then roll the truffles in cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or dip them in chocolate. These can be made 2-3 days ahead! </p>
    <p class="p12"><strong>Step 6: Finish Decorating the Cake.</strong> Once the frosting has set, add your chocolate drip. This is made in the same way we made the truffles – simmering heavy cream is poured over chopped chocolate. See more tips on a chocolate drip in “Expert Tips” below. Place the chocolate truffles on your cake and you are ready to eat!</p>
    <p class="p13">Slice the cake once it’s decorated! You can let it stand at room temp for 15-20 mins before slicing so the frosting isn’t so solid from being in the fridge. Store leftovers (doubtful, hehe!) in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days.</p>
